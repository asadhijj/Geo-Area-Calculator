# PROJECT : GEO AREA CALCULATOR

## AUTHORS : ASAD HIJAWI & MORSHED QATOSEH

## ABOUT THE PROJECT :

This documention about pyhon app to calculate the area of shapes :  we decide a function using def  This def init have to side to return and  Then we using function def area to return the value for the area(it's allow you to modify the way an instance will print ) and then we declared 4 shapes you can choose between hem in diffrent class name  and for def class name function it's hidden attribute refrrs to the name of the class for shapes if you work with triangle the atribute will be triangle and if you choose rectangle the atribute will be rectangle  and if you choose the square the atribute will be square and if you choose Circle the atribute will be a circle and if you choose hexagon the atribute will be hexagon and then we  used thiS ecualiz to find the area (3*sqrt(3)self.side 1**2)\2 
For the users the python app ask them to choose  the shapes and there is an exit  that can the users exit the app and return it back if they want to choose anthor shapes that they need
